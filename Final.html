	<h1>Should The NCAA Be Paying College Athletes?</h1>


	<p>The landscape of College Athletics is changing at a faster pace than ever before with new rule changes that alter the status of what makes an athlete an amateur and NCAA eligible. Student athletes are now able to accept endorsement deals and retain eligibility but there is still a long way to go in the debate regarding whether or not college athletes should be paid. In the case of a conference like the ACC this topic is extremely relevant due to the nature of the teams and athletes that play in it, Duke, North Carolina, Syracuse, and Miami just to name a few. With revenue that comes in each year to schools like that it makes you wonder why the athletes who are the cause of people buying tickets and watching games on television, did not see a dime for these services until this year. And to this day I still do not see any money come from the universities themselves.

<div> <p>In the year 2019 alone the ACC had nearly 1 billion dollars in total expenses relating to athletics. Not a single dollar of that money was given to the athletes and at this time they were not even eligible to receive money for advertisements or they would lose college eligibility and their scholarships. Now, when looking at college athletes being paid for their services not everyone has the right to equal pay, however, there should be a system in place that correlates the revenue that a certain level athlete brings in a certain amount of payment said athlete can receive. 
</p>  

<p>In the year 2019 coaches in the ACC brought in nearly 200 million dollars, and another 17 million to aid in recruitment for their programs. While ACC coaches are near the pinnacle of their professions it raises the question to many as to why they see lofty contracts when they are not on the field, court, or water. It is rare to hear a spectator say they paid to see a game so they could watch a football coach on the sideline, a more popular representation of fans going to a football game to see star quarterbacks and great defenses.

<p>I spoke with former ACC baseball player Zach Dreznin on his opinions about the matter. Zach was a star pitcher at Notre Dame and came from a small town in New Jersey. Zach unfortunately had issues with injuries during his tenure but has seen first hand how business is dealt with as an athlete in the ACC. 
</p> 
<p>One of the key things I took away from our conversation was the value of intangible things he was able to take away from his time at Notre Dame, but even with though he was very happy with his experience he can see the argument as to why star athletes in sports that bring in so much revenue should be paid. 

</p> 

<p>He was also able to help me understand more about the allocation of resources by the schools and what they mean in regards to payment for recruiting and other things that are centered around students. In the case of donations and Student Financial Aid especially. 
</p>

<p>He mentioned that the student financial aid is very important in regards to the conversation because this is imperative to many athletes' ability to even go to college. This money accounts for tutoring, meals, scholarships and more. In the case of the donations that come from a slew of different supporters of the institutions and that goes through all major schools across the nation. Many times when there is controversy surrounding the payment of college athletes donors are involved trying to toe the line of the rules and regulations in order to recruit star athletes to their universities.  </p> 
<p>The whole concept of whether or not to be college athletes has been such a widespread debate for so long I do not see it going anywhere anytime soon. With the NIL changes the NCAA is attempting to save face and keep their athletes happy so they do not avoid college for the expanding amount of alternative routes. I find that in an age where athletes are more outspoken and active than ever the NCAA is going to have to meet their demands in order to remain functioning as a multi billion dollar industry. 
</p> 
<p>The NCAA will forever have the ability to offer the college experience however and they will always try to use that to their advantage. With so much money going to so many people it is only a matter of time before the top athletes get paid, I think it is just a matter of when, and how much?
